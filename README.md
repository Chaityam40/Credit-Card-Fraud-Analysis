During this task, dealt with imputations. One of the unique thing which I did was I had identified duplicate transactions and multi-swipe transactions.

2 -> Exploratory Data Analysis

Performed daa visualizations and provided insights

3 -> Machine Learning Model Building

Performed under-sampling on imbalanced dataset. Developed Random Forest and XGBoost algorithm to build the machine learning model. 

4 -> Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model using accuracy, f1-score, precision score, recall and AUC Curve.
